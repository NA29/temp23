  As a customer, I want to create orders so that I can buy items.
  As a customer, I want to delete orders if I no longer intend to make the purchase.

      | username  | password         | name             | phone          | address                | points |

      | Chicken noodle soup |   179 | non-perishable  |        0 |      2 |
    And the following orders exist in the system
      # There's no way to set the autounique order number, so refer to orders here using a separate ID.
      # The controller should still identify orders by their order number.
      # You'll need to create a map from string IDs to order numbers.
      # Also, please convert the string "NULL" to null (here and in the tests below).
